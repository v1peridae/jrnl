# Jurnl

<p align="center" font-size="30px">Talk about how YOU feel.</p><br><br>
<p>Jurnl is an online jounraling website where you can yap about anything and everything.</p><br><br>
<p>Ok so I changed my mind. Jurnl entries are deletable because some are just random and ppl should have the chance to delete them.</p> <p>BUTTT you wanna know what;s new? YOU CAN SHARE YOUR JURNLS WITH OTHERS! Crazy cool, right! Truly a saviour for yappers. So I guess Jurnl's now a social media :nooo: </p>
